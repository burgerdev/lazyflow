class OpImplementationChoice(Operator):
    '''
    Choose from a predefined set of implementations.

    This operator provides a generic way to choose between multiple
    implementations of an operator interface at runtime. The interface
    is passed as a class in the constructor, which implies that dynamic
    slots (like in OperatorWrapper) are not supported. But you can
    write a short operator that has the correct slots.

    The implementationABC has to be a real operator, although it does
    not have to actually do something useful - you just need to inherit
    from operator and provide the necessary slots. See the unit tests
    for examples. Each input slot that is not available for all
    implementations must be optional. All output slots that are not
    available for the current implementation are set unready via the
    meta.NOTREADY flag.

    For each implementation available, only the slots that are
      * available in implementationABC
      * do not start with an underscore (e.g. self._privateSlot)
    are promoted to the wrapper. 

    Note that the implementing classes do not have to be children
    of the implementationABC, they just have to provide the same slots.
